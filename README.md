# cppcall
Print a string to the console in C++ and call it via Python

This is the flipside of the pycall example https://github.com/gregvw/pycall, where we called a Python function from C++. 
This time we build a Python module from C++ source using the Python/C API and print a string to the console. 

NOTE: Requires Python 3
